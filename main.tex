\abstract{The Aerosol Limb Imager (ALI) is a remote sensing instrument designed to measure scattered sunlight from the atmospheric limb to retrieve spatially resolved 
information of the stratospheric aerosol distribution, including extinction coefficient and particle size. The long term goal of this work is the eventual realization of ALI on 
a satellite platform in low earth orbit. Here we present the development of an ALI prototype and the results from a test flight on a stratospheric balloon. The ALI instrument 
concept uses a large aperture Acousto-Optical Tunable Filter (AOTF) to successively image the stratospheric limb in a selectable narrow wavelength band ranging from the visible 
to the near infrared. The afocal optical system design uses telescopic front end optics to pass collimated light through the AOTF for each line-of-sight, which provides robust 
imaging that is relatively insensitive to impurities in the AOTF, at the cost of a small spectral gradient in the measured image that is negligible for the broad band aerosol 
spectral scattering characteristic. The ALI prototype was tested on a stratospheric balloon flight from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) launch facility in Timmins, Canada, in 
September, 2014. Preliminary analysis of hyperspectral images indicate that the radiance measurements are high quality and can be used to retrieve vertical profiles of 
stratospheric aerosol extinction coefficient and one moment of the particle size distribution.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Stratospheric aerosol plays a fundamental role in the global climate balance. It is generally a spherical particle consisting of hydrated droplets of sulfuric acid that scatters 
incoming solar radiation away from the surface of the planet causing an overall cooling effect which is dependant on extinction and particle size distribution \citep{Kiehl1993}. 
This effect is fully defined by aerosol microphysics and requires accurate knowledge of concentration and particle size distributions. Stratospheric aerosol loading has been 
increasing at a rate of 4-7\% per year from 2002 to 2009 due to moderate volcanic eruptions \citep{Vernier2011}. There has also been a 5.2\% increase per year from 2002 to 2007 
to the surface SO$_{2}$ emissions level which may have lead to an increase in the background stratospheric aerosol layer \citep{Hofmann2009}. The negative radiative effect from 
this increase has potentially partially offset the radiative forcing from CO$_{2}$ \citep{Solomon2011}. During the anticyclone of the asian summer monsoon an aerosol layer forms 
known as the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL). The ATAL is located in the monsoon's large scale anticyclone circulation and the monsoon propels atmospheric constituents 
upwards and isolates them from the external environment. The Asian monsoon can also inject anthropogenic sources of SO$_{2}$ which enter the stratosphere through the ATAL that 
forms during the Asian monsoon \citep{Vernier2011, Neely2014}. Also, the 2011 eruption of Nabro ejected  SO$_{2}$ into the troposphere which was transported into the anticyclone 
of the asian monsoon. The monsoon vertically transported the aerosol across the tropopause into the stratosphere \citep{Bourassa2012c}.

Aerosol in the stratosphere has been monitored from satellite platforms throughout the last few decades. Solar occultation has been used since the 1970s to monitor aerosol in 
the stratosphere and has provided a reliable, accurate and long term database of background and volcanic aerosol extinctions. Notable occultation instruments include SAM II 
\citep{McCormick1979}, SAGE II \citep{McCormick1987}, and SAGE III \citep{Thomason2003} and their combined life cycles gathered measurements from 1978 to 2005. The occultation 
method has the ability to self-calibrate each measurement by directly viewing the sun outside of the atmosphere. The method also directly measures the optical depth allowing for 
simple conversion to extinction without the need for particle size knowledge.

More recently the limb scatter technique, which measures scattered radiance from the sunlit atmosphere, has been used to determine aerosol extinction. Although this geometry has 
the advantage of being able to measure the atmosphere throughout the sunlit conditions, unlike occultation which can only gather measurements during sunrise or sunset events, 
the scattering process requires the use of a forward model to retrieve atmospheric parameters, making the inversion process from limb scatter measurements computationally heavy 
and time intensive. Limb scatter was first preformed on the Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME) \citep{Barth1983} to measure ozone profiles and was followed in the 2000s by 
instruments with the ability to measure aerosol. The Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System (OSIRIS) a Canadian instrument onboard the Odin satellite 
\citep{Llewellyn2004} and SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) onboard the ENVISAT \citep{Bovensmann1999} are two limb scatter 
instruments have successfully determined aerosol atmospheric parameters. OSIRIS has a version 5 data product that contains 750~nm aerosol extinction with a 1~km vertical 
resolution \citep{Bourassa2012a} and was retrieved using the Multiplicative Algebraic Relaxation Technique (MART) method \citep{Degenstein2009} and SCIAMACHY uses an optimal 
estimation method to also retrieve 750~nm aerosol extinction profiles \citep{Ernst2012}. These instruments are grating spectrometers with a single line of sight that acquire 
spectra at a single tangent altitude at a time so a series of exposures is required to create a vertical profile. With approximately a 1.5~km and 3~km vertical resolution for 
OSIRIS and SCIAMACHY respectively. The Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite - Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP) \citep{Rault2013}, launched in 2012, uses a prism to disperse the light and images 
the atmosphere through three verticals slits. Each slit images 100~km vertically with a 1.5~km vertical resolution. The center slit looks backward along the satellite track 
while the other two slits are offset by 4.25\si{\degree} horizontally. The aerosol product for OMPS is retrieved using optimal estimation at wavelengths of 513, 671, 746, 870, 
and 920~nm with 1~km vertical resolution.

A lidar instrument, CALIPSO, measures the atmosphere with profiles of 333~m horizontal resolution and 60~m, 180~m, and 300~m vertical resolution for the altitude ranges of 
8.2-20.2~km, 20.2-30.1~km, and 30.1-40.0~km respectively \citep{Winker2003}. The stratospheric aerosol has been used in studies with a 16 day averaged 3-D grid with a resolution 
of 1\si{\degree} latitude by 2\si{\degree} longitude by 200~m vertically. Each aerosol data cell is the average of 300 to 600 profiles \citep{Vernier2009}. Additional 
instrumentation with high resolutions on the order of 200~m vertically will satisfy the needs for current scientific investigation and will allow the determination of aerosol 
loading. Furthermore, there is a decrease in the number of satellites preforming remote sensing of the atmosphere, newer instruments that fill the scientific requirements are 
required in order to replace these deficiencies. 

ALI will address the much needed horizontal and vertical resolution on the orders of hundreds of meters which is required to better understand aerosol transportation and climate 
effects. ALI will use the limb scatter geometry to gather 2-D spatial images of the atmosphere and gather spectral information by taking measurements at different wavelengths 
using an Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter (AOTF). An AOTF is a device that allows the change of a filtering wavelength without any moving parts and low power consumption. AOTFs 
operate efficiently in the Near InfraRed (NIR) which is a excellent wavelength range for sensitivity to aerosol signal \citep{Rieger2014}. Inherently, AOTFs can only filter 
linear polarized light resulting in ALI only being able to measure a single polarization. Further the bandpass of the AOTF, approximately 2~nm at 600~nm and 7~nm at 1100~nm, are 
well suited with the broadband scattering characteristic of the aerosol signal. ALI measures scattered sunlight from 650-950~nm with a stratospheric balloon flight from Timmins 
Ontario in the fall of 2014.

A similar instrument, the Atmospheric Limb Tracker for the Investigation of the Upcoming Stratosphere (ALTIUS) is a Belgium instrument designed by Belgian Institute for Space 
Aeronomy and its goal is to measure trace gas concentrations from measuring light in the limb scatter geometry as well as solar, stellar, and planetary occultation 
\citep{Dekemper2012}. ALTIUS is a multichannel instrument using three AOTFs with different wavelength bands. The three channels for ALTIUS are an ultraviolet, viable, and NIR 
with wavelength ranges of 250-450~nm, 450-900~nm, and 900-1800~nm respectively and each channel images the atmosphere with 2 spatial dimensions.

In this paper, the first section will outline the fundamental operation of the AOTF used within the ALI system. Following is a description of the optical design behind ALI 
including an ulterior optical design comparing the benefits and drawbacks between two optical layouts. An overview of ALI's maiden flight, including the conditions and 
trajectory of the flight, onboard the CNES CARMEN-2 gondola from the CSA balloon launch facility in Timmins, Ontario is summarized. Post flight analysis of the data is presented 
including the measurements taken during the campaign, the calibration process, and a retrieval algorithm for aerosol extinction and particle size parameters is outlined and 
applied to the data from the balloon campaign.

\section{Instrument Design}

\subsection{Acouto-Optical Tunable Filter}

The primary filtering device behind ALI and the technology that allows two dimensional spatial imaging is the AOTF. It uses an acoustic wave, with its wavelength being 
determined by a Radio Frequency (RF), that is propagated through the crystal and forms a standing wave to create an effect similar to diffraction of a specific wavelength 
causing a filtering effect. The use of an AOTF for an imaging system has several distinct advantages due to its low mass, fast stabilization times of a few microseconds, and no 
moving parts.

Non-collinear acousto devices, which are devices where the input wave and acoustic wave are not aligned, with the use of birefringent materials with large apertures are used in 
imaging systems have been possible since the 1970s \citep{Chang1974}. Thanks to recent advancements of non-collinear AOTF technology these devices can be used efficiently in 
imaging systems including a more accurate tuning curve \citep{Georgiev2002} and consideration in the physical design with increased driving power \citep{Voloshinov2007} have 
allowed for greater resolution.  To create the diffraction of a specific wavelength a momentum matching criteria must be held where the wave vectors of the acoustic wave match 
the difference of the incoming and diffracted light wave vectors as seen in \autoref{fig:3.1:ATOFWavevectors}. This condition is known as the Bragg matching criteria and is 
given by
\begin{equation}
    \ \mathbf{k}_{i} = \boldsymbol\kappa + \mathbf{k}_{d}
    \label{eqn:3.1:phaseMatching}
\end{equation}
where $\left|\mathbf{k}_{i}\right| = \frac{2\pi n_{i}}{\lambda}$ is the wave number of the incoming light, $\left|\mathbf{k}_{d}\right| = \frac{2\pi n_{d}}{\lambda}$ is the wave 
number of the diffracted light, and $\left|\boldsymbol\kappa\right| = \frac{2\pi F}{\nu}$ is the wave number of the acousto wave. The parameters $\lambda$, $F$, and $\nu$ are 
the wavelength in vacuum, the frequency of the RF wave, and the phase velocity in the crystal respectively. Using the condition given in \autoref{eqn:3.1:phaseMatching} and the 
wave vector diagram gives the following relation for a birefringent material undergoing Bragg diffraction
\begin{equation}
    \lambda  = \frac{\Delta n\nu}{F}\frac{\sin^{2}(\theta_{i}+\alpha)}{\sin\theta_{i}}
    \label{eqn:3.1:AOTFWavelengthDependance}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta n$ is the absolute difference between the ordinary and extraordinary indices of refraction, $\theta_{i}$ is the angle of incidence of the incoming light, and 
$\alpha$ is the angle the acoustic wave propagates though the device. This equation has several implications to the operation of the device, first the wavelength diffracted by 
the AOTF is inversely related to frequency of the RF wave. Second, the wavelength of outgoing signal is dependant the angle of incidence of the incoming wave therefore passing a 
signal though the AOTF at different incident angles will result in a different outgoing wavelengths. Also, through the described interaction the diffracted light goes though a 
90\si{\degree} rotation in polarization \citep{Voloshinov1996}.

A 10x10~mm aperture imaging quality ATOF was acquired from Brimrose of America. It is optically tuned, meaning designed for a specific wavelength octave, for a range of 600 to 
1200~nm corresponding to a RF range of 156 to 70~MHz. It is made from Tellurium Dioxide (TeO$_{2}$), a birefringent crystal with indices of refraction at 800~nm of 2.226 and 
2.373 for the ordinary and extraordinary modes respectively \citep{Uchida1971}. The extraordinary light is diffracted 2.7 degrees from the optical axis of the device. In order 
to achieve a constant diffraction angle the rear surface of the crystal is cut in a wedge shape to compensate for the angular change that occurs from altering the wavelength. 
The ordinary light undergoes diffraction but at a nonconstant angle from the optical axis with respect to wavelength. It is important to note that it is not possible to have 
both polarizations compensated and ALI is designed to measure the extraordinary polarization.

\subsection{AOTF Characterization}

The relationship between the RF tuning frequency, the central wavelength, and the spectral Point Spread Function (PSF) was obtained by passing focused light through the AOTF in 
the lab. In this system, linear polarizers were inserted before and after the AOTF to remove unwanted polarizations. 100~mm plano-convex lenses were chosen for the front and 
back end lenses to optimally fill the AOTF aperture. The light source was a 100~W quartz-tungsten halogen bulb that was collimated and passed into the first lens. The light 
passes though the AOTF focused then is re-collimated through the second lens. The signal enters a HORIBA iHR320 spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 1.175~nm. The spectral 
results were imaged on a Synapse 354308 front-illuminated CCD detector with 1024x256 pixels. Images were taken at a set of RFs spaced every 150~kHz from 75~MHz to 160~MHz. For 
each image the results are spectrally averaged across the rows and a typical result can be seen in \autoref{fig:3.1:AOTFCharaterization:a}. The maximum value of each image is 
taken to be the central wavelength through the AOTF at each respective RF.

The maximum values from each of the images were determined as well as the corresponding wavelengths for these values. It was noted that the wavelength versus RF curve 
(\autoref{fig:3.1:AOTFCharaterization:c}) appears to follow a power function of the form
\begin{equation}
    \ F = a\lambda^{b}.
    \label{eqn:3.1:powerFunction}
\end{equation}
A linear least squares fit was preformed in log space finding the coefficients $a$ and $b$. The fit provided an agreement better than 0.6\% within the testing range. A better 
fit was found in the form of
 \begin{equation}
    \ F = a\lambda^{b+c\log\lambda}.
    \label{eqn:3.1:modifiedPowerFunction}
\end{equation}
These results can be seen in \autoref{fig:3.1:AOTFCharaterization:c} and \autoref{fig:3.1:AOTFCharaterization:d}. The agreement of this form is less than 0.1\% throughout the 
whole wavelength range and the determined RF and wavelength relation as determined as
\begin{equation}
    \ F = \exp{(19.793)}\lambda^{-3.381+0.168\log\lambda}
    \label{eqn:3.1:modifiedPowerFunctionCoeffiecicents}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is in nanometers and $F$ is in MHz. It should be noted that even though the AOTF optical range is 600~nm to 1200~nm our analysis only measured wavelengths from 
600~nm to 1080~nm due to the low quantum efficiency of the CCD beyond this range.

The same set of data was used to determine spectral PSF by finding the Full Width Half Max (FWHM) for each of the above determined wavelengths. These results are shown in 
\autoref{fig:3.1:AOTFCharaterization:b}. The AOTF spectral resolution is well within the limits that are required in order to determine aerosol extinction in the upper 
troposphere and lower stratosphere since aerosol is a broadband scatterer.

The diffraction efficiency was determined using two sets of data; the first set is the data used to  characterize the wavelength-RF dependance of the AOTF, the second set is a 
measurement of the light that was incident to the AOTF in the previous experiment. To acquired the incident data the AOTF and linear polarizer on the back end of the optical 
chain was removed. The light source is measured again with the spectrometer without the diffraction of the AOTF. By taking the ratio of the diffracted wavelength over the 
incident radiance the diffraction efficiency was determined. The determined diffraction efficiency is between 56\% to 64\% across the measured spectral range and should be noted 
that the diffraction efficiency changes with respect to incoming angle \citep{Xu1992}.

\subsection{Optical Design and Performance}

The ALI prototype design and performance discussed in this work has been designed with balloon geometry in mind, accounting for a larger field of view to be able to image the 
desired range of 35~km vertically and horizontally. The eventual goal for an ALI based instrument is a satellite mission in a low earth orbit (approximately 600~km). A smaller 
field of view will be required to have the same 35x35~km field of view. For a stratospheric balloon at a float altitude of 35~km to be able to capture the entire range a field 
of view of 6\si{\degree} is required. However for a low earth orbit, to capture the same range a field of view of only 0.8\si{\degree} is required. A comparison of the two 
geometries can be seen in \autoref{fig:5.4:balloonGeometry}.

The AOTF limits the optical system to only having two practical layouts since the incoming light must enter the device at less than the acceptance angle, which is the maximum 
angle light can enter the device and still undergo an efficient diffraction interaction. These two layouts are a telecentric and a telescopic system. The telescopic or afocal 
system causes a wavelength gradient to be formed across the field of view of the image whereas the telecentric design overcomes this problem but has a larger spectral FWHM 
\citep{Suhre2004}.

A telecentric layout on both the front and back end of the AOTF leads to focused light passing through the AOTF. The filtered image has a consistent central wavelength across 
the entire image with a larger spectral FWHM since the diffracted wavelength is dependent on incident angle as seen in \autoref{eqn:3.1:AOTFWavelengthDependance}. This system 
does have two inherent issues. First, this method is sensitive to any surface defects of the crystal since the light enters the crystal in focused bundles. Second, an effect 
caused by a shift in the location of the imaging focal plane occurs that is dependant on wavelength. This effect is caused by the inherent change of optical path length. The 
optical path between the first two lenes is a fixed distance, however the AOTF is made of TeO$_{2}$ or paratellurite and has a high index of refraction. The crystal also has a 
high dispersive property, or Abbe number, so the index of refraction depends on the wavelength. The dispersive nature gives an apparent change in the optical path length 
dependant on wavelength. The change in path length, $d$, is given by
\begin{equation}
    \ d(\lambda) = \frac{n(\lambda)-1}{n(\lambda)}t
    \label{eqn:3.2:opticalPathDisplacement}
\end{equation}
which is derived from the physical geometry where $n(\lambda)$ is the index of refraction with a wavelength dependance and $t$ is the thickness of the crystal. The AOTF crystal 
causes the optical path in air to be lengthened by $d$, and in order to compensate, the length, $d$, must be added to the path to account for the discrepancy, but this can only 
be accounted for a specific wavelength. Defocusing will occur at the image plane for all other wavelengths and in order to correct for this problem additional compensating 
optics would need to be added or the CCD would need to be actively moved as the wavelengths are being scanned.

In the telescoptic system the AOTF has collimated light for each line of sight passing through the device and this has a few fundamental changes that alter the system's imaging 
quality. First, the light passing through the AOTF from a single line of sight enters the AOTF at the same angle, so the image will have a narrower spectral PSF than the 
telecentric counterpart. However, each line of sight will be diffracted with a different fundamental central wavelength due to the angular dependance in the AOTF Bragg 
diffraction (\autoref{eqn:3.1:AOTFWavelengthDependance}). The final image has a smaller spectral bandpass but there will be a wavelength gradient radiating out from the center 
of the image. Second, since light now passes through the AOTF collimated, the focal point of the image no longer changes with wavelength. Instead a lateral displacement of each 
line of sight occurs based on the angle of incidence and the diffracted wavelength which causes a slight change in magnification of the final image. The lateral displacement 
that occurs is given by the following relation
\begin{equation}
    \delta = (n(\lambda)-1)\frac{t\theta}{n(\lambda)}
    \label{eqn:3.2:planeParallelDiplacement}
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is the displacement from the original path. This magnification is a negligible change overall amounting to a maximum 0.04~mm on the detector for the current ALI 
design.

The telescopic system offers the ability of having an image plane location that is not dependant on the wavelength being imaged and was the ultimate optical design chosen for 
ALI. A telecentric system would lead to an optical layout that would either require mechanical components to move the imaging plane, additional optical elements to counteract 
the change in the optical path, or have lower resolution spatially at some wavelengths. For the second solution, an alternative custom lens or prism would need to be created in 
order to counteract the defocusing effect of the AOTF which would be outside of scope for the simple prototype design desired for ALI. The telescopic design allows for higher 
spatial resolution, which aligns with the goal of imaging the fine structure of aerosol extinction on the order of hundreds of metres.

Another minor consideration for the system is the central wavelength of each line of sight is dependant upon the angle of incident on the AOTF crystal which results in a 
wavelength gradient in the final image. The shortest wavelength occurs in the center of the image and radiates outward towards longer wavelengths as apparent in 
\autoref{eqn:3.1:AOTFWavelengthDependance}. Using the telescoptic layout with a 6\si{\degree} field of view ALI would have a wavelength gradient of approximately 7~nm at 650~nm 
central wavelength and 11~nm at 950~nm, however for a space based instrument with a relatively smaller field of view the gradient could be reduced to as small as 2~nm across the 
whole image which, at worse, is slightly larger than the FWHM of the AOTF. This effect would be a significant problem for instruments measuring trace gases absorption lines, for 
example NO$_{2}$, but aerosol scattering is a broadband spectral feature from the visible well into the IR. The wavelength dependent magnification mentioned earlier only amounts 
to a change of a approximately 0.4\% in both directions from the inherent magnification from 650~nm to 950~nm and overall this change is considered negligible.

Therefore we have chosen a telescopic design. For ALI, a simple three lens optical layout was chosen for the system using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. Two lens 
before the AOTF to form the front end optics and one lens comprises the back end optics. Consideration was given when choosing the lenses with regard to aperture size in order 
to reach approximately one second exposure times during the mission. In order to be able to achieve the increased light throughput a demagnification occurs in the front end 
optics resulting in a tightening of the collimated light bundles allowing more light to enter the aperture of the AOTF. A field stop is added at the intermediate imaging point 
between the first two lenses to help reduce unwanted signal from continuing though the optical chain. Before the light enters the AOTF a linear polarizer is used to remove the 
incoming horizontal or ordinary polarized light, which is the polarization that is not imaged by ALI, removing the 0th and 1st order horizontal polarization from propagating 
through the system. The diffracted wavelength undergoes a 90\si{\degree} rotation in polarization so a second linear polarizer at 90\si{\degree} to the first is used after the 
AOTF to remove the undiffracted beam. The diffracted light is 2.7\si{\degree} from the optical axis and to compensate, the rest of the optical chain after the AOTF is aligned 
with this direction. A final imaging lens forms the image of the signal on a QSI 616s CCD which has a 16 bit output with 1536x1024 9~\si{\micro\metre} pixels with a 15 count 
error on the readout for typical operating temperatures. A ray tracing diagram for ALI's optical system was created using the CODE V optical design software and can be seen in 
\autoref{fig:3.2:telescopicRayTracing}. Analysis of the final design was also performed using the CODE V optical design software to determine the minimum resolution required to 
achieve an MTF of 0.3 across the entire field of view. To achieve a minimum MTF of 0.3 across the entire field of view an average of 7 pixels is required making the average 
vertical and horizontal resolution of ALI across the entire field of view 210~m. The final optical specification for ALI can be found in \autoref{tab:3.2:ALISystemParameters}. 
Due to contamination from the zeroth order beam, a loss of 1\si{\degree} horizontal field of view occurs on the right side of the field of view giving an effective field of view 
of 6\si{\degree} by 5\si{\degree}.

\end{table}

Another concern in the design of limb scatter instruments is the effect of out-of-field stray light that contaminates the final measurement. A front end baffle was designed and 
built using a method that maximizes the percentage of out-of-field light that will encounter at least three surfaces before entering the aperture of ALI. To further reduce the 
unwanted signal the baffle maintains a height to pitch ratio greater than 0.5 \citep{Fischer2008}.

A SolidWorks rendition of the completed version of ALI can be seen in \autoref{fig:3.3:aliSystemDiagram}. ALI is tilted at 3\si{\degree} from the horizontal so the complete 
6\si{\degree} vertical field of view spans from the tangent point to the ground to the float altitude. A diagram can be seen in \autoref{fig:5.4:balloonGeometry}.

ALI is similar in design and concept to the Belgium instrument, ALTIUS, except ALTIUS uses a telecentric optical layout and is designed to measure atmospheric trace gases 
\citep{Dekemper2012}. Trace gases have narrow absorbtion features that require higher spectral resolution. A telecentric layout will provide a constant wavelength across the 
whole field of view. The optical specifications are similar between the two instruments, however two key differences will be noted. First, by using a telescopic layout ALI's 
maximum field of view is determined by choosing lenses to ensure light enters ALI within the acceptance angle of the AOTF allowing for a larger possible field of view than on a 
telecentric system where the field view is defined by the aperture of the AOTF. Second, the f/\# for ALTIUS is 14.32 compared to ALI's 7.5 which allows ALI to increase light 
throughput at the cost of slightly higher abberations in the final image. The visible channel of ALTIUS was breadboarded and tested by imaging a smoke stack in order determine 
NO$_{2}$ slant column density at 3.5~km away with a 10 second exposure times \citep{Dekemper2012}. It was noted that improvements to the system would result from methods to 
reduce the amount the stray light that enters the ALTIUS system, as well as a reduction in the time in between measurements and an improvement in the flat-fielding and spectral 
calibrations of the instrument.

\subsection{Calibration and Operational Software}
\label{sec:Calibration}

With the completed ALI prototype. calibrations and software testing were preformed on ALI. The calibrations were preformed with the goal to convert the ALI measurements into 
radiances to be used in a retrieval algorithm, including the removal of dark current, stray light, and flat-fielding. Second, a description of the operation software used on ALI 
during the mission will be described.

An experiment to characterize the stray light of the overall system was performed. Two types of stray light have been defined for ALI; first the out-of-field stray light is 
radiance that enters the optical path that is outside of the measured field of view. Second is internal stray light which is caused by optical elements not completely absorbing 
or removing any undesired wavelengths and polarizations. Stray light removal has always been difficult in atmospheric instrumentation due to the difficulty in accurately 
discerning the signal in regards to the stray light contamination. Furthermore, ALI's optical system has additional unwanted light internal to the instrument because of the 
rejection of one of the polarizations due to the nature of the AOTF. The signal enters the optical system unpolarized, but only one polarization has a constant output angle from 
the AOTF. The light is first passed through a linear polarizer with an extinction ratio of at least 100,000:1 to remove the unwanted polarization. However a small percentage is 
not absorbed. Furthermore, a second linear polarizer is used after the AOTF to reject the undiffracted signal and once again a small percentage of this is not absorbed leading 
to potentially substantial stray light in the optical housing. However, the diffraction interaction only occurs when the RF signal is applied, so without the RF wave the 
recorded measurement will only contain the stray light in the system. Using this characteristic another experiment was devised to determine the stray light of the system. A 
250~W quartz-tungsten light source was passed through a dispersing screen and into the entrance aperture of ALI filling the entire field of view. Using a variety of exposure 
times ranging from 0.1~s to 60~s and wavelengths from 650 to 950~nm in 25~nm intervals the incoming source was imaged twice for each unique combination; one image recorded with 
the AOTF in its off state, with no driving RF wave, and one with the ATOF in its on state, with the RF wave. Once all the images were acquired the DC offset was removed and the 
counts were divided by the exposure times to give counts per second. Essentially, the image with the AOTF off only contains stray light in the system, as previously stated, and 
the ``AOTF on'' image contains the stray light combined with the uniform signal from the light source. By subtracting the ``AOTF-off'' image from the ``AOTF-on'' image yields an 
image that just contains the desired signal. The resulting images were the brightest in the centre and experienced vignetting towards the edges. The vignetting is caused by the 
aperture of the AOTF. In order to be able to use this method during the balloon campaign all images captured  will have a corresponding ``AOTF-off'' image recorded as well.

To complete calibrations flat-fielding needs to be performed on the images to yield the radiances. The resulting images from the stray light removal experiment were used to 
determine the coefficients for flat fielding. The coefficients were found in two steps. First, the spatial coefficients needed to be found for each individual image and second 
the spectral coefficients needed to be determined across wavelength. The spatial coefficients were found by determining the value needed to scale each pixel up to the average 
measurement of the center 25 by 25 pixels of each image. The images were sorted by wavelength and each set of scaled image values was noted to be within 4\% of each other. The 
spatial coefficients for each set were averaged to find the final spatial coefficients for each wavelength with a 4\% error. Second the spectral dependance was determined. ALI 
is most sensitive at 775~nm so this wavelength was chosen as the reference wavelength and all coefficients were scaled to yield the same value as the 775~nm spatially flat 
fielded images. The choice to relatively calibrate the ALI radiances to the 775~nm value was performed since no absolute calibration was performed on ALI. The final 
flat-fielding coefficients were the spatial times the spectral coefficients. The final images radiances are called relative radiance since the results are not absolutely 
calibrated.

During the calibration process software was designed for the ALI system to be used for the balloon campaign. ALI was operated with a Debian Linux operating system with threaded 
C++ based software to control the hardware and science operations that would initiate with system power on. The onboard computer was a VersaLogic PC-104 OCELOT computer with 
fanless operation and a 1.6~GHz Intel Atom processor with 2~GB of RAM and has a thermal operating range of -40 to 85\si{\degree C}. The onboard system communicated to a ground 
based station through UDP protocol and sends data, including images and house keeping information, to the ground, as well as receives commands from ground control.

\section{Stratospheric Balloon Flight}

\subsection{Flight Day Conditions and Flight Path}

The balloon launch base in Timmins, Ontario is located at 48.47\si{\degree}N 81.33\si{\degree}W and ALI was integrated onto the CNES CARMEN-2 gondola with CARMEN-2's systems, 
including communications and power. ALI was orientated so it would be 90\si{\degree} from the azimuthal direction of the sun with an overall southern field of view during the 
mission. ALI measures light that is polarized vertically and computed values shows the vertical polarization only accounts for 10 to 35\% of the total incoming radiance for the 
balloon geometry. CARMEN-2 is a pointed gondola and its pointing precision is better than 1\si{\arcminute} with the use of an onboard star tracker.

On September 20, 2014 at 05:35 UTC (01:35 local time) ALI was launched as part of the Nimbus 7 mission from the CSA Timmins balloon launch facility. During the launch, the sky 
was clear with light winds allowing for a safe and uneventful launch. The ascent of CARMEN-2 occurred in darkness and reached its flight altitude of 36.5~km at 8:17 UTC. First 
light was observed by ALI at 9:39 UTC and recorded measurements until 14:42 UTC when the primary aerosol observations were complete and ALI was powered off at 17:15 UTC. A 
visualization of the flight path with major landmarks noted can be found on \autoref{fig:5.1:nimbus7FlightPath:a}. Temperature profiles for the ambient atmosphere and instrument 
can be seen in \autoref{fig:5.1:nimbus7FlightPath:b}. The black curve is the ambient atmospheric temperature surrounding the gondola during the flight from the ECMWF 
\citep{Molteni1996}. The blue, green, and red are from temperature sensors onboard ALI located on the baffle, camera, and RF driver respectively. The baffle temperature sensor 
was attached just on the inside of the ALI right by the entrance aperture for the system and monitors the temperature at the front of the system. The camera sensor is attached 
to the back of the CCD camera and the RF driver sensor measures the temperature of the RF driver which is used to control the AOTF. ALI was thermally insulated with foam to keep 
the system warm, while at the same time direct heating from the sun was a concern so the system was covered in a reflecting material to reduce solar heating.

During the mission, ALI operated in two primary acquisition modes, a ``dark'' mode and an aerosol imaging mode. The first mode, the ``dark'' mode, was primarily used during 
assent and intermittently between aerosol modes. During this mode the filtering of the AOTF was disabled, meaning no RF signal is applied to the crystal, and the system images 
stay light and dark current. Eight exposures are taken with 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 second exposure times with the camera shutter operating. The second operational mode, 
the aerosol mode, recorded 13 measurements at selected wavelengths every 25~nm between 650 to 950~nm. Each measurement is then a pair of images, an ``AOTF-on'' and ``AOTF-off'' 
image. Each measurement set took approximately 35~s to acquire with exposure time varying between 0.5 to 6 seconds.

\subsection{Measurements}

After the successful recovery of ALI 216 raw images were download (known as the level 0 data) and calibration was preformed to convert them into relative radiances (level 1 
data) using the calibration methods discussed in \autoref{sec:Calibration}, removing the DC offset, stray light, and the application of the flat fielding coefficients. An 
example of an image with all calibrations applied can be seen in \autoref{fig:AfterImagesHorizontalDependance:a}. This is image number 212 at 750~nm.

To increase the precision of the measurements to a minimum of 0.3 MTF from the flight the images were averaged in cells of 25 horizontal pixels and vertical pixels resulting in 
the measured radiances on a 1~km grid.  ALI radiance profiles from the complete mission from the center column of the detector are shown in \autoref{fig:AliRadiancesVectors}. 
This includes wavelengths from 675-950~nm. The first set of radiance profiles that start near zero and move toward the large values are the radiance profiles that were recorded 
during sunrise and the gradual increase was therefore expected. Once the sun had completely risen past the terminator the relative radiance vectors follow a similar shape and 
have a similar magnitude with some variability corresponding largely to thin clouds. Image 212 was selected to demonstrate radiance differences between different horizontal 
lines of sight which can be seen in \autoref{fig:AfterImagesHorizontalDependance:b}. The anomaly is determined by calculating the mean vertical relative radiance profile and 
removing it across the field of view. These clouds were formed after sunrise and appeared to be optically thin and formed in thin vertical layers only a kilometer in height and 
some high altitude stray light appears in the final image. Lastly, images 204 to 216 were used to show the spectrum of relative radiances at a series of altitudes which is seen 
in \autoref{fig:AliSpectralRadiances} with the error of the relative radiances represented by the shading. The level 1 radiance data can now be used in the retrieval process.

\subsection{Retrievals}
\label{sec:retrievals}

The modeled radiances for the nonlinear inversion were computed with the SASKTRAN radiative transfer engine \citep{Bourassa2008a} for High Resolution (SASKTRAN-HR) 
\citep{Zawada2015} measurements using the newly developed polarization module \citep{Dueck2015}. The model uses a given atmospheric state to solve the radiative transfer 
equation to determine the final radiance at the observer that follows the integral radiative transfer equation:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{I}(s_{1}) = \mathbf{I}(s_{0})e^{-\tau(s_{0}, s_{1})}+\int^{s_{1}}_{s_{0}}k(s)\mathbf{J}(s)e^{-\tau(s, s_{1})}ds
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{I}(s_{1})$ is the vector radiance at the observer through a path from $s_{0}$ to $s_{1}$, the first term is the contribution of light that is attenuated along the 
line of sight from the sun to the observer at $s_{1}$. The second term takes the vector source term, $\mathbf{J}(s)$, which is the radiance scattered into the line of sight, and 
integrates the path along line of sight with attenuation to determine the scattering contribution to the final radiance. The extinction, given by $k(s)$, is the sum of the 
number density, $n(s)$, multiplied by the scattering cross section, $\sigma(s)$, over all species and $\tau$ is the optical depth. Furthermore SASKTRAN-HR uses a complete 
spherical geometry and accounts for multiple scattering terms. The polarized output of SASKTRAN-HR gives the Stokes vectors for the radiance on the model reference frame which 
can then be rotated into the instrument's coordinate system. Once rotated the polarization required to match the ALI measurement is the vertical polarization given by
\begin{equation}
    I = \frac{1}{2}\left(\mathrm{S_{0}}-\mathrm{S_{1}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{S_{0}}$ and $\mathrm{S_{1}}$ are Stokes parameters defined by $\mathrm{S_{0}} = \left<E_{x}^{2}\right> + \left<E_{y}^{2}\right>$ and $\mathrm{S_{1}} = 
\left<E_{x}^{2}\right> - \left<E_{y}^{2}\right>$. The variables $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ are the horizontal and vertical component of the electric field in the instrument frame.

The relative radiance level 1 data from ALI are used to create measurement vectors, $\mathbf{y}$, in the following form
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{y} = 
\log\left(\frac{\mathbf{I}(\mathbf{z},\lambda)}{I(z_{ref},\lambda)}\right)-\log\left(\frac{\mathbf{I}_{rayleigh}(\mathbf{z},\lambda)}{I_{rayleigh}(z_{ref},\lambda)}\right)
    \label{eqn:measurementVector}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{I}(\mathbf{z},\lambda)$ is the measured radiance from ALI and $I(z_{ref},\lambda)$ is the radiance at a reference altitude used to normalize the signal from a 
high altitude where there is little aerosol contribution, for ALI the highest possible altitude where the signal is above the noise threshold is approximately 30~km tangent 
height. The second term uses modeled radiances from SASKTRAN-HR with only the molecular atmosphere to approximately remove the Rayleigh signal. This is done to improve the speed 
of the convergence of the retrieval. The ALI measurement vector is similar to the measurement vector used for the OSIRIS retrieval \citep{Bourassa2007,Bourassa2011}. An initial 
guess state, $\mathbf{x}$, for the aerosol extinction and particle size distribution profiles are set in the SASKTRAN-HR model. The forward model vector is constructed 
similarity to the measurement vector and follows.
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}) = 
\log\left(\frac{\mathbf{I}_{mod}(\mathbf{z},\lambda)}{I_{mod}(z_{ref},\lambda)}\right)-\log\left(\frac{\mathbf{I}_{rayleigh}(\mathbf{z},\lambda)}{I_{rayleigh}(z_{ref},\lambda)}\right)
    \label{eqn:forwardModel}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{I}_{mod}(\mathbf{z},\lambda)$ is the modeled radiance for the measurement and $I_{mod}(z_{ref},\lambda)$ is the measurement at the same reference altitude for 
normalization. The forward model is used in combination with the measurement vector to update the extinction profile using Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstruction Technique 
(MART) algorithm which was developed for use in the OSIRIS retrievals \citep{Bourassa2012a} with the following iterative technique
\begin{equation}
    x_{i}^{n+1} = x_{i}^{n}\sum_{j}\frac{y_{j}}{F(z_{j})}W_{ij}
\end{equation}
where $x_{i}$ is the aerosol extinction at each shell altitude, $i$ and $j$ is the tangent point from the measurements. $W_{ij}$ is the weighting matrix that relates the 
importance of each measurement vector to each shell altitude. This method was outlined by \cite{Degenstein2009} and allows for fast retrievals without calculating a Jacobian 
which can be computationally expensive for limb scatter.

An error estimation was performed using a perturbation method \citep{Bourassa2012b}. Once a retrieval has been completed for an image the result is used to estimate the error in 
the returned extinction. For each altitude, the measurement vector is perturbed and the change in the retrieved profile is determined, a gain matrix, $\mathbf{G}$, is created 
comprised of the change in the extinction over the change in the measurement vector. The gain matrix has size $n$ by $m$ which are the shell altitudes and the tangent altitudes 
grids respectively. The error at each retrieved altitude is then given by
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{G}\mathbf{S}_{\epsilon}\mathbf{G}^{T}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{S}_{\epsilon}$ is the covariance matrix of the measurement vector and $\mathbf{E}$ is the covariance of the retrieved aerosol profile. The precision for ALI is 
taken has the square root of the diagonal of $\mathbf{E}$ \citep{Rodgers2000}.

Once the retrieval has been preformed for a complete series of wavelengths; determination of the Angstr\"{o}m exponent is preformed in a similar method as outlined by 
\cite{Rault2013} for the OMPS aerosol particle size retrieval. The method outlined by \cite{Rieger2014} is not used due to ALI not measuring long enough wavelengths. The 
Angstr\"{o}m exponent is an approximation to the spectral dependance of the Mie scattering cross section. Lower Angstr\"{o}m exponents correspond to larger particle sizes and 
vice versa for small particle sizes. The scattering cross section for aerosol is dependant on the particle size distribution, and since the number density must be a constant 
across wavelength, the extinction changes with a change in cross section. From \autoref{eqn:agstromCoefficient} the particle size profile from a series wavelength can be 
determined from the Angst\"{o}m exponent. Since the measurements observe relatively the same atmosphere over the time of one complete aerosol cycle; the differences between 
extinction ratios at the different wavelength can be used to gather a understanding of aerosol particle size in the form
\begin{equation}
    \frac{n\sigma}{n_{0}\sigma_{0}} = \left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{0}}\right)^{-\alpha}
    \label{eqn:agstromCoefficient}
\end{equation}
which characterizes the cross section particle size dependance verses wavelength where $n$ is the aerosol concentration, and $\sigma$ is the scattering cross section. For the 
retrieval described here a single mode log-normal distribution is assumed with a mode radius, $r_{g}$, and the mode width, $\sigma_{g}$, which is the same as the OSIRIS version 
5.07 aerosol product.  At each retrieved altitude the extinction from each wavelength is used to fit the Angstr\"{o}m exponent. Then the median value from all the retrieved 
altitudes is used as the new size parameters in next iteration of the retrieval. The mode width is set at a constant 1.6 and the mode radius is allowed to vary to match the 
Angstr\"{o}m exponent retrieved \citep{Bourassa2008b, Rieger2014}. The mode radius is updated and the process is repeated, re-retrieving the extinction profiles, until the 
Angstr\"{o}m exponent converges. At the end of the last iteration, the Angstr\"{o}m exponent profile is reported as the final particle size product.

In order to be able to use the ALI data in the MART method certain quantities were needed for the model; albedo, ozone concentration and cross sections, and aerosol cross 
sections. The ozone absorbtion features from the Chappuis band appear in the ALI measurements from 650 to 700~nm. The ozone profiles were acquired from OSIRIS. Five scans that 
were within 48 hours of the balloon flight and within 500~km of the launch facility were averaged together to be the ozone profile used in the SASKTRAN-HR model, with cross 
sections from \cite{Burrows1999}. The albedo is from the ADAM database which has monthly values for albedo over the surface on earth at a resolution of 
0.1\si{\degree}~x~0.1\si{\degree} grid at 1~nm spectral resolution \citep{Muller2013}. The aerosol cross sections come from the Mie scattering derivation that was originally 
proposed by Mie and was implemented efficiently by \cite{Wiscombe1980}. For the purpose of the retrieval an initial guess profile was used with a constant mode radius of 
0.08~$\si{\micro\metre}$  and a mode width of 1.6 which is considered a standard size distribution for aerosol \citep{Deshler2003}.

\subsection{Results}

The complete mission consisted of 216 images that were recorded in illuminated conditions. The MART retrieval method was run on a select set for the purpose of the analysis, 
specifically the last complete set of images from 650 to 950~nm consisting of images 204-216. The complete set of retrieved aerosol extinction profiles can be seen in the left 
panel of \autoref{fig:AliAerosolCycle}. After the retrieval the difference between the measurement and forward model vectors were less than 2\% for the the majority of the 
retrieval region, approximately 13~km to 24~km, across all wavelengths. From the retrieval altitudes the aerosol extinction shows a decrease as the wavelength increases which is 
expected due to the dependance of the cross section with respect to particle size.

The aerosol profile for the ALI 750~nm aerosol extinction is shown in blue with the shading representing the precision of the retrieved profile on the right of 
\autoref{fig:AliAerosolCycle}. The error is strictly based on measurement error and neglects any model and atmospheric state errors. The green curve is the average 750~nm 
aerosol extinction profiles of the same five OSIRIS scans used for the ozone profile and red is the 750~nm aerosol extinction from SALOMON \citep{Berthet2002} which was launched 
from the Timmins balloon base as the Nimbus 5 mission on September 12, 2014. The aerosol extinction for ALI and OSIRIS are within 50\% of each other for a majority of the 750~nm 
profile and is the wavelength where agreement is best. It also should be noted that the three instruments follow the same overall profile shape.  First, a bend in the profile 
occurs at approximately 25~km, then increases approximately linearly until 15~km where aerosol extinction leaves the linear trend and forms the peak of the measurement. 

The particle size method was used as outlined in the pervious section. The first panel of \autoref{fig:ParticleSize} shows the median Angstr\"{o}m exponent that was determined 
after each iteration and convergence can be seen after a couple iterations. The particle size determined for ALI in the last complete set of aerosol images can be seen in the 
second panel of \autoref{fig:ParticleSize} which yields a final Angstr\"{o}m exponent of between 2 and 3 throughout the altitude range from 13 to 22~km. Assuming a mode width of 
1.6 yields a median mode radius of 0.096~\si{\micro\metre}.

In order to determine the Angstr\"{o}m exponent a least squares fit was used for all wavelengths at each altitude. A wavelength at an altitude was rejected if the forward model 
at that shell altitude was not within 2\% of the measurement vector. In the case shown in \autoref{fig:ParticleSize}, the 20.5~km shell altitude, only 10 of the 13 possible 
wavelengths contributed to the determination of the Angstr\"{o}m exponent.

\section{Conclusions and Future Prospects}

A description of the ALI prototype using an AOTF for active filtering in the visible to near IR with a telescopic optical layout with the purpose to measure aerosol extinction 
from the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere with a high vertical and horizontal resolution with images was presented here. The AOTF has fast stabilization times and the 
ability to disable the filter gives an excellent method to remove stray light from the final measurements. ALI is able to measure aerosol microphysics in atmospheric remote 
sensing.

ALI was tested on board the CARMEN-2 gondola from the balloon launch facility at Timmins, Ontario. Aerosol extinction profiles were determined and had good comparisons to ORISIS 
and SALOMON in profile shape. The absolute extinction values are different by a large amounts but can be attributed to the large amount of unaccounted systematics in the 
retrieval algorithm. Overall, ALI preformed admirably and verified the use of this technology for future atmospheric remote sensing missions.

Future upgrades to ALI would include the realignment of the optics for flight temperatures to allow for higher resolution measurements and retrievals. Secondly, replacing the 
CCD currently used on ALI with a camera with faster readout would allow for a higher quantity of data to be taken by reducing the approximate 35~s readout time down to a smaller 
value necessary for a satellite missions on the order of 1~s per wavelength.

This work would have not been possible without funding from the CSA to design and build ALI through the FAST program as well as the CSA building and managing the launch facility 
in Timmins, Ontario. Also, thanks to CNES for funding and overseeing the launches at Timmins in 2014. As well thanks Nick Lloyd for help in development of the flight code, 
without his efforts this work would have not been accomplished.
